# Progress

Source of truth for requirements: `docs/proposal.pdf`. It's kept out of git because it holds
personal contact details.

## Decisions (2026-10-13)
1. **Acceptance ROUGE** is measured on the internal benchmark (≥ 240 texts with long human
   references). XL-Sum test ROUGE is reported for comparison only. Nothing is tuned on either.
2. **Length strategy**: (B) segment-wise abstractive summarization. Sentence-group segments
   are well under the 900-token cap with ≤ 80 tokens of overlap. Each segment gets a share of
   the length budget, segments are summarized with length-controlled decoding, duplicates are
   removed, the ratio is enforced, and a merge pass follows. This competes against (C), a
   hybrid where extractive sentence selection is followed by abstractive rewriting, as the
   proposal requires "abstractive vs hybrid". (D), longer-reference training data, is optional
   and only used if a properly licensed set exists (SumArabic license unverified). An
   extractive lead/TextRank baseline is also reported.
3. **AraT5v2** gets a single comparison run (no full LR grid) because T5 fp16 on a T4 is
   unstable. The full grid {1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5} runs on AraBART.
4. **Model-size limit (≤ 1 GB)** applies to the optimized model plus tokenizer. AraT5v2 FP32
   (about 1.47 GB) can only pass after INT8.
5. **Benchmark news half** is drawn from XL-Sum *test* articles of 300–1000 words, stratified
   by length (300–499 / 500–699 / 700–1000), excluding any article in a duplicate pair, and
   oversampled to 150 candidates. Each gets a new human reference. The 1-sentence XL-Sum
   summary is kept only as `source_highlight`. The organizational-report half comes from the
   team via `incoming_org/`.
6. **References**: never model-generated. All references, including source-provided ones, need
   a second-reviewer approval (stricter than the proposal). Key points (≥ 3) are recorded for the
   proposal's 80% coverage check. Guideline: `docs/reference_guideline.md` v1.0.
7. **XL-Sum loading**: the raw archive is downloaded at pinned commit `30fece4…` and SHA256
   verified (`371a07df…`) instead of using `datasets.load_dataset`, because recent `datasets`
   releases don't run loading scripts.
8. **Dedup**: SHA256 of matching-normalized text plus MinHash/LSH (5-word shingles, 128 perms,
   Jaccard ≥ 0.8). Greedy by split priority test > validation > train. Only train rows are
   removed; eval splits are flagged, never modified.
9. **Normalization**: two policies. *model*: NFKC, strip tatweel and diacritics, fold Persian
   ی/ک, keep alef/ى/ة spelling and digits. *matching*: additionally folds alef, ى→ي, ة→ه,
   digits to ASCII, and removes punctuation. The matching policy is used only for hashing,
   dedup, ROUGE tokenization and fact matching.
10. **Colab versions**: we pin the packages we install. Colab's preinstalled stack (torch,
    pandas, …) isn't downgraded; its exact versions are saved per run in
    `logs/env_*.json` and `logs/pip_freeze_*.txt`. The final lock file is assembled from these.

## Benchmark report must also record (proposal §7)
CPU model, thread count, OS version, warm-up time, and per-sample input length. This goes into `bench/` later.

## Next
- User runs `01_data.ipynb` in Colab and pastes back the output of cells 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9.
- Then: `02_preprocess.ipynb` (sentence splitter, chunker, hierarchical pipeline, tests).
